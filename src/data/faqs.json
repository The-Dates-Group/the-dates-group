    "question": "Can I pay you from the funds awarded in the grant?",
    "answer": "The Grant Professionals Association (GPA) says, \"Compensation should not be written into grants unless allowed by the funder\" and they most often forbid it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I pay only if I am awarded the grant?",
    "answer": "Grant writers do the same amount of work whether or not a proposal is funded. They receive compensation for any and all services rendered."

  {
    "question": "Can I pay a percentage based on the funded amount?",
    "answer": "The Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP) Standards of Professional Practice notes: \"Members shall not accept compensation that is based on a percentage of charitable contributions; nor shall they accept finder’s fees.” “AFP holds that percentage-based compensation can encourage abuses, imperils the integrity of the voluntary sector, and undermines the very philanthropic values on which the voluntary sector is based.\""

  {
    "question": "Do I choose the grants, or does Dates Group find them?",
    "answer": "The cost per hour is applied to any time the writers are providing research.

We have several databases that will typically have grants that are not commonly accessed through basic google searches or other search engines."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a typical time frame for a grant from request to submission?",
    "answer": "This depends on the grant. Typically, nonprofit grants tale much longer than for-profit grants. Some for profit grants can take as little as 3 hours. That is not uncommon. Some nonprofit grants can take as long as 25 hours."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the timeframe for an outcome for a grant after submission?",
    "answer": "The funder will share the terms of the grant. In the terms you will know when the grant becomes available for submission and when the submission period closes. You will also know when they will determine or announce who has been awarded. Some grants can close out one day and announce who is awarded in 3-5 days. But other grants may close, for example, in December, but not make a determination until June. Dates Group LLC has no role in the timing of this."
